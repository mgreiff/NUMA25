# Numerical algorithms
* B-splines: Generates splines of arbitrary polynomial degree > 1 when
  provided 2D control points (blossom recursion) or points to intersect
  (de Boor's algorithm in combination with a blossom recursion).
* TSP: Solves the travelling salesman problem using the branch and bound method.
